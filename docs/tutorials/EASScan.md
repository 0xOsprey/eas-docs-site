# EAS Scan

EASScan is the attestation and schema explorer for EAS. It provides easy access to the latest on/off-chain attestations
and schemas running on EAS. It allows developers and users to view and verify attestations made using the Ethereum
Attestation
Service (EAS) and the global schema registry.

## Using the EAS Scanner

Now that you understand the basics of EAS and the schema registry, let's take a look at how to use the EAS Scanner to
view attestations and schemas.

### Viewing Attestations

You can view a list of the most recent attestations made on EAS by going to
the [Attestations page](https://easscan.com/attestations). If you know the UID of the attestation you want to view, you
can go directly to the attestation page by typing the UID into the search bar.

You can then view the details of the attestation, including the data that was attested to, the schema that was used, and
the address of the attester.

### Viewing Schemas

The EAS Scanner also allows you to view the schemas in the schema registry. To view a schema, you need to know the UID
or name of the schema, or use the EAS API to query for schemas. Once you have the UID or name of the schema, you can
easily find and display details of the schema, including the fields and data types, as well as the attestations that
have been made using that schema.

## Why use EAS Scanner?

EAS Scanner provides a simple and convenient way to search for and view attestations made using EAS and the global
schema registry. Additionally, EAS Scanner can be used to learn more about the schemas and data being attested on the
Ethereum blockchain, and can help developers to better understand the capabilities of EAS and the global schema
registry.
