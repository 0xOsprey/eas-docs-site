![Attestations Concept](./img/attestations-concept-2.png)

`Attestations` are a digital records cryptographically signed by someone about anything. They can be made by anyone (a person, company, group) to attest to the identity, credentials, or other information of individuals, organizations, and other entities. This can be useful for a wide range of applications, such as proving ownership, verifying credit scores, or verifying the trustworthiness of an individual or entity.

The **value of an attestation** comes from the person or entity making the statement. If the statement is about something important, like whether someone has a good credit score, then the attestation is only valuable if it comes from a reliable source, like one of the credit score providers. If the attestation just comes from the person who wants a loan or lease, it's not as valuable.

### Why Attestations Matter
Attestations are important because they provide a way to establish trust and credibility in the digital world. In the absence of physical presence or direct interaction, it can be difficult to know whether information is accurate or reliable. Attestations provide a third-party endorsement and cryptographically signed proof of the validity of a piece of information, making it easier for others to trust and rely on that information.

### Comparison to DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and Other Solutions
There are a number of technologies and solutions that are related to or overlap with attestations, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. At their core, these are just types of attestations for a specific use case. Here is a brief comparison of these technologies:

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** DIDs are a type of digital identifier that are decentralized and self-sovereign, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity and can be owned and managed by the individual or organization that holds them. DIDs are often used in conjunction with attestations, as they provide a way to identify the issuer or subject of an attestation.

- **Verifiable Credentials:** Verifiable Credentials are a type of digital credential that can be cryptographically verified as authentic. They are often used to represent educational or professional qualifications, as well as other types of identity information. Verifiable Credentials are built on top of DIDs and can be used in conjunction with attestations to provide a more robust and secure way of verifying credentials.

- **Other Solutions:** There are a number of other technologies and solutions that are related to or overlap with attestations, including Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) frameworks, Identity Hubs, and Identity Wallets. These solutions provide different approaches to managing and verifying identity information, and may be used in conjunction with attestations to provide additional security and functionality.

### üôå Examples of Attestations

Attestations can be used in a wide range of situations to verify information about a person, place, or thing. Some examples of types of attestations include:

- **Identity:** Verifying who someone is
- **Credentials:** Proving someone's skills and credibility
- **Ownership:** Confirming ownership of a particular item
- **Credit score:** Demonstrating someone's financial status
- **Vote:** Showing who someone trusts to represent them
- **Nationality:** Establishing where someone is from
- **Eligibility:** Determining what someone has access to
- **Reputation:** Demonstrating how people perceive someone

Here are a few examples of situations where you might encounter attestations:
- **liking** a Twitter post on the internet,
- **reviewing** a restaurant or product online,
- **using** your personal ID to prove who you are,
- **proving** your ownership of your car or home,
- **accessing** a building with a keycard,
- **buying** tickets to a concert or event,
- **applying** for a job or a mortgage,
- **voting** in your local community group or presidential election,
- **verifying** someone is trustworthy or not,
- **claiming** you have a set of skills.
and the list goes on...
