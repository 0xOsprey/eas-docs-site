# Attestations 

:::info What are attestations?
**Attestations** /ˌaˌteˈstāSH(ə)n; are any and all types of certifications, claims, verifications, evidence, declarations, and proof that something exists or is the case. 
:::

EAS is a system for registering, verifying, and revoking attestations. EAS makes it possible to register attestations on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a public ledger. This means that anyone can verify the attestation and it cannot be changed. 

### 🙌 Attestations happen all around us.
We **see** and **experience** attestations all around us in our everyday lives. Attestations happen every time you need to prove your or someone else's:
- `identity` (who they are), 
- `credentials` (their skills & credibility), 
- `ownership` (what they own), 
- `credit score` (their financial status),
- `vote` (who they trust to represent them), 
- `nationality` (where they are from), 
- `eligibility` (what they have access to),
- `reputation` (how peope percieve them).

When you are attesting or being attested to, you are proving that you are who you say you are, that you own what you say you own, or that you have the skills you say you have. Here are a few examples of when you might experience attestations at play:
- **like** a twitter post on the internet,
- **review** a restaurant or product online, 
- **use** your personal ID to prove who you are,
- **prove** your ownership of your car or home,
- **access** a building with a keycard,
- **buy** tickets to your favorite concert or event,
- **apply** for a job or a mortgage,
- **vote** in your local community group or presidential election,
- **verify** someone is trustworthy or not,
- **claim** you have a set of skills.
- and the list goes on...

The value of the attestation comes from the person or entity making the statement. If the statement is about something important, like whether someone has a good credit score, then the attestation is only valuable if it comes from a reliable source, like one of the credit score providers. If the attestation just comes from the person who wants a loan or lease, it's not as valuable.

## On & Off-Chain Attestations

EAS allows you to create and attest on & off chain attestations. 

### 🔗 On-Chain Attestations 

An on-chain attestation is an attestation, or statement, that is published on the blockchain for the world to see. This means that its timestamp can be guaranteed, and any smart contract on the blockchain can easily reference and verify the attestation. On-chain attestations can be used for things like oracles, reputation, and KYC validation for DeFi with securities. 

**On-chain attestations** in Web3 are often called decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifications, claims, proofs, and badges. 

While each of the existing providers adds unique use cases, they ultimately are not primitive enough to enable long-term, sustainable, and composable growth. Below are a few examples of on-chain attestation builders that could register their schemas with EAS for greater long-term growth.

- Gitcoin Passport
- Proof of Humanity
- Sismo
- Layer 3
- Galxe
- POAP
- Disco
- Lens
- Polygon ID

And more …


### 🔓 Off-Chain Attestations 

An off-chain attestation is an attestation that is not stored in the blockchain. An off-chain attestation can be public or private. Off-chain attestations carry the entire attestation data and digital signature required to verify and validate the authenticity of itself. Off-chain attestations can be used for things like ticketing, drivers licenses, passports, votes, and tweets. Almost anything that can be done on-chain can be done off-chain, but you can't retain privacy as well on-chain.

We’re exposed to off-chain attestations all the time. Some of the most popular examples of off-chain attestations that can be recorded on EAS and are:

- Identification cards
- Your passport
- Your vote
- Vital records like birth certificates
- Healthcare records
- Tickets to events
- Social posts (tweets)
- Land registries & titles
- Document signatures
- 2-factor authentication
- Car titles
- Mortgages
- Credit scores
And more …
