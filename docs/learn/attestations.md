# What are Attestations

:::info What are attestations?
**Attestations** /ÀåaÀåteÀàstƒÅSH(…ô)n; are statements or evidence of information made by anyone about anything.

![Attestations Concept](./img/attestations-concept-2.png)

An `Attestation` is a digital record that is cryptographically signed by an individual, company, or group to verify the
identity, credentials, or other information about an individual, organization, or entity. These attestations can be used
for a variety of purposes, such as verifying identity, building reputation, and conducting voting processes.

The **credibility** of an attestation is determined by the reliability of the person or entity making the statement. If
the attestation is about a significant topic, such as a credit score, it is only considered valuable if it comes from a
trusted source, such as a credit score provider. On the other hand, if the attestation is made by the person seeking a
loan or lease, it is not as credible.

### Why Attestations Matter

Attestations are crucial because they offer a means of establishing trust and credibility in the digital realm. In the
absence of face-to-face interaction or physical presence, it can be challenging to determine the accuracy or reliability
of information. Attestations provide third-party validation and a cryptographically signed confirmation of the
authenticity of a piece of information, making it easier for others to trust and depend on that information.

### Comparison to DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and Other Solutions

There are a variety of technologies and solutions that are related to or overlap with attestations, including
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. Essentially, these are just different types of attestations
for specific use cases. Here is a comparison of these technologies:

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** DIDs are a type of digital identifier that are decentralized and self-sovereign,
  meaning they are not controlled by any single entity and can be owned and managed by the individual or organization
  that holds them. DIDs are often used in conjunction with attestations, as they provide a way to identify the issuer or
  subject of an attestation.

- **Verifiable Credentials:** Verifiable Credentials are a type of digital credential that can be cryptographically
  verified as authentic. They are often used to represent educational or professional qualifications, as well as other
  types of identity information. Verifiable Credentials are essentially just a type of attestation that is used for some
  specific purposes. A credential can be an attestation, but a attestation is not necessarily a credential.

- **Other Solutions:** There are several other technologies and solutions that are related to or overlap with
  attestations, including Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) frameworks, Identity Hubs, and Identity Wallets. These solutions
  provide different approaches to managing and verifying identity information and may be used in conjunction with
  attestations to provide additional security and functionality.

### üôå Examples of Attestations

Attestations can be used in a wide range of situations to verify information about a person, place, or thing. Some
examples of types of attestations include:

- **Identity:** Verifying who someone is
- **Credentials:** Proving someone's skills and credibility
- **Ownership:** Confirming ownership of a specific item
- **Credit score:** Demonstrating someone's financial status
- **Vote:** Showing who someone trusts to represent them
- **Nationality:** Establishing where someone is from
- **Eligibility:** Determining what someone has access to
- **Reputation:** Demonstrating how people perceive someone

Here are a few examples of situations where you might encounter attestations:

- **liking** a Twitter post on the internet,
- **reviewing** a restaurant or product online,
- **using** your personal ID to prove who you are,
- **proving** your ownership of your car or home,
- **accessing** a building with a keycard,
- **buying** tickets to a concert or event,
- **applying** for a job or a mortgage,
- **voting** in your local community group or presidential election,
- **verifying** someone is trustworthy or not,
- **claiming** you have a set of skills.
  and the list goes on...
