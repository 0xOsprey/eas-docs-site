# Attestations 

:::info What are attestations?
**Attestations** /ˌaˌteˈstāSH(ə)n; are any and all types of certifications, claims, verifications, evidence, declarations, and proof that something exists or is the case. 
:::

EAS is a system for registering, verifying, and revoking attestations. Attestations are information that can be used to prove something about a person or thing. EAS makes it possible to register attestations on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a public ledger. This means that anyone can verify the attestation and it cannot be changed. 

### Attestations happen all around us.
We **see** and **experience** attestations all around us in our everyday lives. Attestations happen every time you need to prove your or someone else's:
- `identity` (who they are), 
- `credentials` (their skills & credibility), 
- `ownership` (what they own), 
- `credit score` (their financial status),
- `vote` (who they trust to represent them), 
- `nationality` (where they are from), 
- `eligibility` (what they have access to),
- `reputation` (how peope percieve them).

Some examples when you experience attestations are when you:
- **like** a twitter post on the internet,
- **review** a restaurant or product online, 
- **use** your personal ID to prove who you are,
- **prove** your ownership of your car or home,
- **access** a building with a keycard,
- **buy** tickets to your favorite concert or event,
- **apply** for a job or a mortgage,
- **vote** in your local community group or presidential election,
- **verify** someone is trustworthy or not,
- **claim** you have a set of skills.

The value of the attestation comes from the person or entity making the statement. If the statement is about something important, like whether someone has a good credit score, then the attestation is only valuable if it comes from a reliable source, like one of the credit score providers. If the attestation just comes from the person who wants a loan or lease, it's not as valuable.

## On & Off-Chain Attestations

### 🔗 On-Chain Attestations 

**On-chain attestations** in Web3 are often called decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifications, claims, proofs, and badges. 

Some of the popular EVM on-chain attestation providers today that can register a schema on EAS are:
```bash
- Gitcoin Passport
- Proof of Humanity
- Sismo
- Layer 3
- Galxe
- POAP
- Disco
- Lens
- Polygon ID
And more …
```

### 🔓 Off-Chain Attestations 

We’re exposed to off-chain attestations all the time. Some of the most popular examples of off-chain attestations that can be recorded privately on EAS and increase composability for real-world use cases are:

```bash
- Identification cards
- Your passport
- Your vote
- Vital records like birth certificates
- Healthcare records
- Tickets to events
- Social posts (tweets)
- Land registries & titles
- Document signatures
- 2-factor authentication
- Car titles
- Mortgages
- Credit scores
And more …
```
