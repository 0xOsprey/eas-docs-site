# Attestations 

:::info What are attestations?
**Attestations** /ˌaˌteˈstāSH(ə)n; are any and all types of certifications, claims, verifications, evidence, declarations, and proof that something exists or is the case. 
:::

We see and experience attestations all around us in our everyday lives. Anytime we must prove our identity, credentials, ownership, credit scores, nationality, eligibility, reputation, boarding a plane, like or review something on the internet, and even buying tickets to access your favorite concert, we are seeing attestations at work. 

### ✅ Attestation examples:
Take a look at our  [Use Cases Docs](/docs/category/use-cases) for some inspiration on what EAS can solve for.
