# What are Attestations

:::info What are attestations?
**Attestations** /ÀåaÀåteÀàstƒÅSH(…ô)n; are digital records or evidence of information made by anyone about anything.

![Attestations Concept](./img/attestations-concept-2.png)

An `Attestation` is a digital record that is cryptographically signed by an individual, company, or group to verify the
identity, credentials, or other information about an individual, organization, or entity. These attestations can be used
for a variety of purposes, such as verifying identity, building reputation, and conducting voting processes.

The **credibility** of an attestation is determined by the reliability of the person or entity making the statement. If
the attestation is about a significant topic, such as a credit score, it is only considered valuable if it comes from a
trusted source, such as a credit score provider. On the other hand, if the attestation is made by the person seeking a
loan or lease, it is not as credible.

### Why Attestations Matter

Attestations are crucial because they offer a means of establishing trust and credibility online. In the
absence of face-to-face interaction or physical presence, it can be challenging to determine the accuracy or reliability
of information. Attestations provide third-party validation and a cryptographically signed confirmation of the
authenticity of a piece of information, making it easier for others to trust and depend on that information.

### üôå Examples of Attestations

Attestations can be used in a wide range of situations to verify information about a person, place, or thing. Some
examples of types of attestations include:

- **Identity:** Verifying who someone is
- **Reputation:** Demonstrating how people perceive someone
- **Credentials:** Proving someone's skills and credibility
- **Credit score:** Demonstrating someone's financial status
- **Ownership:** Confirming ownership of a specific item
- **Nationality:** Establishing where someone is from
- **Eligibility:** Determining what someone has access to
- **Vote:** Showing who someone trusts to represent them
- **Provenance:** Verifying the origin of goods in a supply chain
- **Compliance:** Verifying that an entity is in compliance or followed procedures
- **Authenticity:** Proving the authenticity of anything.

Here are a few examples of situations where you might encounter attestations:

- **liking** a Twitter post on the internet,
- **reviewing** a restaurant or product online,
- **using** your personal ID to prove who you are,
- **proving** your ownership of your car or home,
- **accessing** a building with a keycard,
- **buying** tickets to a concert or event,
- **applying** for a job or a mortgage,
- **voting** in your local community group or presidential election,
- **verifying** someone is trustworthy or not,
- **claiming** you have a set of skills.
  and the list goes on...

### üõ† How Attestations Work
Attestations work by leveraging cryptographic signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI). When an individual, company, or organization creates an attestation, they sign it with their private key. This signature can then be verified by anyone with access to the corresponding public key, ensuring the authenticity of the attestation.

EAS uses two simple smart contracts. One for registering a schema about any attestation topic, and the other for making attestations with that schema.

### üåâ Interoperability and Standardization
Attestations can be made more powerful by establishing interoperability and standardization between different systems and platforms. By creating a common language for attestations and enabling seamless integration, we can further enhance trust and credibility in the digital world.

EAS plays an important role in fostering this interoperability and standardization. It provides a base layer and open platform for creating and verifying attestations, allowing different identity solutions to work together seamlessly and enabling individuals to manage their identity in a decentralized and secure way.

### üöÄ Get Started with Attestations
Attestations have the power to revolutionize trust and credibility in the digital world. To get started with attestations, explore the EAS platform, educational resources, and documentation. Make use of the no-code schema builder, SDK, and other tools to create and verify attestations quickly and easily.
