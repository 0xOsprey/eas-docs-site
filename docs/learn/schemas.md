# Schemas
A schema is a way of organizing data. Schemas are the building blocks to all attestations. They establish the rules and conditions you want to attest with. You can create schemas about anything, and they are completely customizable. This means that you can choose preexisting schemas that meet your needs or compose new ones with more fields or different naming conventions. 

:::caution Remeber! The value of an attestation does not come from the schema. It comes from the Attestor using the schema.

Let's use Schema [#33 - Make A Statement](https://easscan.com/schema/view/0x62a336a890b6828afc5f3ae3f37d0acf3054d14d23d8de7a25ccf2068c203a7e) as an example. This schema allows anyone to add a statement that they can attest to. You could use this schema to attest to a statement you make or to one that someone else makes!

## A few example schemas
The registry has a bunch of different schemas that people have created. You can use these schemas to attest to different things, like a statement you make or a review you write about a restaurant. You can also create your own schemas to attest to whatever you want. The use-cases are endless. You can even compose schemas together like lego blocks to make more robust schemas.
