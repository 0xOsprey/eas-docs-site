# Problem & Impact
In today's digital world, fraud, mistrust, misrepresentation, and misuse are widespread issues that create fear and uncertainty in our interactions with each other. This lack of trust hinders the user experience for decentralized apps and pushes traditional web2 business models towards further centralization. EAS offers a solution to this problem by building trust in all digital interactions through attestations.

EAS initially focused on solving the [digital identity](/docs/Use%20Cases/digital-identity) and reputation problem. However, we recognized the need for a generic ledger allowing any entity to attest about anything. This global base layer for attestations has the potential to address significant issues and make a positive impact on the Ethereum ecosystem and society. EAS enables anyone to register a schema about any topic and create attestations using that schema, providing a secure and transparent way to verify the authenticity of attestations and create an immutable record of information online, ultimately combating fraud and mistrust.

EAS aims to establish greater interoperability with other identity and attestation builders passionate about fostering trust in Ethereum. We created a base layer and standard for making any type of attestation, recognizing that without a standardized and open platform for creating and verifying attestations, identity solutions and the attestation ecosystem will remain fragmented and incomplete.

## Problems we see
- **Lack of trust and transparency in various applications:** By allowing anyone to create and verify attestations, EAS helps provide transparent and verifiable proof of the authenticity and integrity of products, services, and information on Ethereum, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing consumer/builder confidence.

- **Inefficient and fragmented attestation market:** EAS aims to improve the efficiency and interoperability of the attestation market by providing a standardized and open-source platform for creating and verifying attestations that can be used across different use cases and audiences.

- **Limited adoption and use of attestation solutions:** Although attestation solutions such as DIDs, VCs, and Badges have the potential to offer numerous benefits, they have often struggled to achieve widespread adoption and use. EAS aims to increase the adoption and use of attestation protocols by making it easy for developers to integrate all types of attestations into their projects. Our comprehensive developer documentation and an initial SDK will make it easy for developers to create and verify attestations, lowering the barriers to entry for building attestation-based solutions.

- **Lack of a comprehensive and flexible base layer for attestation protocols:** While there are several existing attestation protocols, many are specialized for specific use cases and are not easily extensible or adaptable to new applications. EAS provides a comprehensive and flexible base layer for attestation protocols, allowing developers to build and register customized schemas for their particular use cases and enabling the creation of new attestation protocols and applications on top of EAS.

- **Lack of a public good for attestation services:** EAS is a public good for making attestations on Ethereum. It is open-source, permissionless, and free to use, and was created for the benefit of the Ethereum ecosystem. EAS is intended to be a valuable resource for all members of the community and is not encumbered or incentivized by centralized teams or tokenization, making it a pure ETH public good.


## Expected Effects on the Ethereum Ecosystem

- **Increased use of the Ethereum blockchain:** EAS provides a valuable service that increases trust throughout all online interactions and information. This can help drive the adoption of Ethereum in a variety of applications, both on the Web and in Web3.

- **Improved trust and transparency:** By increasing trust and transparency in various applications, EAS can help reduce fraud and increase confidence in the integrity of information on the Ethereum network and online.

- **Improved Web3 user experiences:** EAS can make it easier for users to create and verify attestations, which can improve the overall user experience in applications that make use of or would benefit from attestations. This could drive more widespread adoption of Ethereum-based applications.

- **Enabling new use cases:** EAS aims to enable new and innovative use cases that rely on trust and transparency, such as verifiable identity and credentials, supply chain management, reputation systems, and beyond. By providing a secure and decentralized platform for creating and verifying attestations, EAS can help enable a wide range of use cases that were previously difficult or impossible to implement.

- **Greater interoperability:** As a composable and interoperable service, EAS enables advanced and flexible solutions that can take advantage of different technologies and protocols within the Ethereum ecosystem.

- **Increased collaboration and community involvement:** By providing a useful service and fostering greater collaboration and community involvement, EAS will help build stronger connections and relationships between Ethereum-based projects and organizations. This will benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem by creating a more cohesive and collaborative community.
