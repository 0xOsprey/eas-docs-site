# EAS as a Public Good
Public goods are essential to the success of open-source projects and the Ethereum ecosystem, as they help to foster innovation and collaboration. By providing a shared infrastructure and open access to information and resources, public goods enable developers and organizations to build on and extend existing projects, creating new and innovative solutions. This helps to drive the development and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.

## Built for the community
EAS will result in a public good by providing a decentralized, open-source solution for creating and verifying attestations. This service will be available to the entire Ethereum community and will not be restricted to any particular group or individual.

EAS will create a shared infrastructure that anyone can use to create and verify attestations for their particular use case. This shared infrastructure will enable more efficient and trustworthy communication between parties, as they will be able to rely on a common and composable protocol for making and verifying attestations.

In addition, EAS will be openly shared and available for anyone to use and build upon, encouraging the development of new and innovative applications and use cases for attestations. This open access will benefit the Ethereum community by fostering creativity and innovation.

Finally, EAS will also contribute to the community by providing educational resources and documentation to help developers and users understand and effectively use the service. This will help to build a strong and knowledgeable community around EAS, which will in turn contribute to the overall strength and success of the Ethereum ecosystem. By providing a shared infrastructure, open access, and educational resources, EAS will create a public good that benefits the entire Ethereum community.


## Why this matters
EAS distinguishes itself from other solutions for on-chain and off-chain attestations due to its simplicity, decentralization, focus on composability, and commitment to being a public good. As an open-source, permissionless, and tokenless solution, EAS is easily integrable and flexible for a wide range of applications.

Being a primitive base layer for on-chain and off-chain attestations provides a common framework for building more advanced applications. This makes it a valuable infrastructure project for the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling the creation of a variety of trust and integrity solutions on top of it. Additionally, EAS is focused on interoperability and aims to enable the creation of a universal, open-source layer for attestations that can be used and integrated by a variety of different applications and protocols. This means that existing solutions that rely on attestations can register and leverage the attestations made on EAS to make their protocols more interoperable and compatible with a wider range of systems.
