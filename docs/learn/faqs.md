<details>
<summary>How does EAS work?</summary>
EAS is runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It is built on two simple smart contracts: one for registering attestation schemas, and another for creating and verifying attestations.

To use EAS, you will need to have an Ethereum wallet and some ETH to pay for gas fees. You can then create and register attestation schemas, create attestations, and verify attestations using the EAS platform.

To create and register an attestation schema, you will need to provide a schema that defines the data that the attestation will include. Once the schema is registered, it can be used to create and verify attestations.

To create an attestation, you will need to provide the data that the attestation will include, as well as the schema that the attestation will follow. The attestation will be cryptographically signed and added to the Ethereum blockchain, where it can be securely stored and verified. Attestations can also be stored off-chain.

To verify an attestation, you can use the EAS platform to retrieve the attestation from the Ethereum blockchain and verify its authenticity and integrity. This can be done by checking the cryptographic signature and verifying that the attestation follows the rules and constraints defined in the schema.

<details>
<summary>How is EAS a public good?</summary>
EAS is not owned by a centralized business or team. It is an open-source project built on Ethereum for the Ethereum community to help the Ethereum ecosystem grow. Anyone can use it for their own use cases and contribute to the growth and adoption of EAS.
</details>


 <details>
 <summary>How is EAS different from existing DIDs, verifiable credentials, and claim protocols?</summary>
EAS is permissionless and composable, and does not pressupose anything. 
Existing DIDs, verifiable credentials, and claim protocols are attestations built for specific use cases and communities. EAS serves as the base registry for these attestation providers to help make the ecosystem more composable and interoperable.

- EAS does not define which schemas are best for a specific use case.
- EAS is completely open-source and not controlled by centralized teams.
- EAS is a base layer that can be used to build and integrate DIDs, credentials, claims, proofs, and more.
- EAS is an agreed upon format and standard for attesting about anything.
- EAS is tokenless.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Does EAS have pre-defined schemas?</summary>
No. EAS does not pressupose any schema for the use case. This allows more freedom from the community to create the RIGHT schemas for the RIGHT users overtime.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the global registry for attestations?</summary>
The global registry for attestations is a decentralized database where anyone can register and share unique attestation schemas. This registry enables interoperability and composability between different attestation protocols and solutions, allowing the attestation layer to grow and evolve over time.

### ‚úÖ Learn about Attestations
Attestations is a funky word, but we attest it's easy to learn.

:::info FAQs

<details><summary>What are attestations?</summary>

Attestations are digital records that verify the authenticity of information. They can be used in a wide range of applications, such as verifying a person's identity or credentials.

For example, if you need to prove that you have a certain degree or certification, you can use an attestation to provide evidence of this. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as applying for a job or trying to access certain services.

Attestations are useful because they provide a way to verify the authenticity of information in a trustless manner. This means that you don't need to rely on a centralized authority to verify the information, which can be useful in situations where it's difficult or impossible to do so.

Tip! Remember that the value of an attestation comes from the person making the attestation or verifing it. An attestation for your credit score that comes from your friend is not going to hold much weight. However, an attestation from a credit bureau will. 

</details>

<details><summary>How do attestations work on Ethereum?</summary>

Attestations on Ethereum are created and verified using smart contracts. These contracts define the rules for creating and verifying attestations, such as the data that must be included and the conditions that must be met for an attestation to be valid.

To create an attestation on Ethereum, users must first create a schema that defines the structure and rules for the attestation. Once the schema is created, users can then create an attestation by providing the required data and signing the attestation with their Ethereum wallet.

To verify an attestation, users can check the attestation against the schema and verify that the attestation data is valid and has been signed by a trusted source.

</details>

<details><summary>Where do Attestation's get their value from?</summary>

One potential limitation to using attestations is that they rely on the integrity and trustworthiness of the Attestor, who is responsible for creating and signing the attestation. If an Attestor is not trustworthy, their attestations may not be reliable.

Additionally, the value of an attestation depends on the context in which it is used. For example, an attestation that is reliable in one context may not be as reliable in another context. It is important to carefully consider the specific use case and the reliability of the Attestor when using attestations.

</details>



<details><summary>What are on-chain attestations?</summary>

An on-chain attestation is an attestation that is published on the blockchain for the world to see. Because of this it‚Äôs timestamp can be guaranteed and any smart contract on the blockchain can easily reference and verify the attestation. Use cases: Oracles, reputation, KYC validation for DeFi with securities, supply chain, etc.

Almost anything that can be done on-chain can be done off-chain, but you cant retain privacy well onchain.

</details>

<details><summary>What are off-chain attestations?</summary>

An off-chain attestation is an attestation that is not stored in the blockchain. An off-chain attestation can be public or private. Off-chain attestations carry the entire attestation data and digital signature required to verify and validate the authenticity of itself. Off-chain uses: Ticketing, Drivers license, Passport, Vote, Tweets (messages)
