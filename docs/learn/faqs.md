<details><summary>What are attestations?</summary>

Attestations are digital records that verify the authenticity of information. They can be used in a wide range of applications, such as verifying a person's identity or credentials.

For example, if you need to prove that you have a certain degree or certification, you can use an attestation to provide evidence of this. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as applying for a job or trying to access certain services.

Attestations are useful because they provide a way to verify the authenticity of information in a trustless manner. This means that you don't need to rely on a centralized authority to verify the information, which can be useful in situations where it's difficult or impossible to do so.

Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) is a platform that allows anyone to create and use attestations.
