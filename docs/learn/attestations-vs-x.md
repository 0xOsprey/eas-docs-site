# Attestation Types
As a developer working in the Ethereum ecosystem, you've probably heard the terms "attestations," "DID," "verifiable credentials," "claims," "badges," and "proofs" used in various contexts. While these terms are related and often overlap in their meanings and uses, it can be confusing to understand exactly what they mean and how they differ from one another.

Let's clear up the confusion and provide a concise explanation of the differences between these terms. By the end of this page, you'll have a better understanding of what each term means and how it is used in the context of the Ethereum ecosystem. Whether you're new to the space or an experienced developer, this resource will help you navigate the often-confusing landscape of web3 terminology.

### Attestations
Attestations are statements or evidence of information made by anyone about anything. They can be used to verify the identity, credentials, or other information of individuals, organizations, and other entities. Attestations provide a way to establish trust and credibility in the digital world, as they provide a third-party endorsement and cryptographically signed proof of the validity of a piece of information.

### Common Terms
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** - Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a type of digital identifier that are decentralized and self-sovereign, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity and can be owned and managed by the individual or organization that holds them. DIDs are often used in conjunction with attestations, as they provide a way to identify the issuer or subject of an attestation.
- **Verifiable Credentials** - Verifiable Credentials are a type of digital credential that can be cryptographically verified as authentic. They are often used to represent educational or professional qualifications, as well as other types of identity information. Verifiable Credentials are built on top of DIDs and can be used in conjunction with or replaced by attestations to provide a more robust and secure way of verifying credentials.
- **Claims** - Claims are statements made by an individual or organization that are meant to be proven or supported by evidence. Claims can be made about any topic, and they can be used in a variety of contexts, such as legal proceedings, marketing, or social media. Claims are just a form of attestation but may not be cryptographically signed like an attestation on EAS.
- **Proofs** - A proof is a piece of evidence or a statement that is used to establish the truth or validity of something. In the context of the Ethereum ecosystem, a proof is often used to verify the authenticity or correctness of a piece of information. A proof might be used to verify the ownership of a piece of digital art, the authenticity of a digital certificate, or the correctness of a computation. In these cases, the proof would provide a way for someone to independently verify that the information in question is accurate.
- **Badges** - Badges are digital symbols that can be used to represent achievements, qualifications, or membership in a particular group or organization. In the context of Ethereum, badges can be issued and verified using verifiable credentials or as NFTs. Badges are not tamper-proof and often transferrable.

## Wrapping things up
Overall, attestations, DIDs, and other concepts such as verifiable credentials, claims, badges, and proofs can all be considered types of attestations in the sense that they are used to provide information about an individual or organization in a secure and verifiable way. However, they each have their own specific definitions and uses, and they can be used for different purposes depending on the specific needs of an application.

Incorporating attestations into Ethereum projects can provide a secure and decentralized way for entities to authenticate themselves and their attributes on the web. By leveraging the power of attestations on EAS, developers can create a wide range of applications that rely on trust and reputation, rather than just financial value. This will help to unlock new use cases and expand the capabilities of the decentralized web beyond just intermediated exchange.
