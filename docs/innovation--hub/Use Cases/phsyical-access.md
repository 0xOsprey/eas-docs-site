# Verified User Identity in Physical Locations

## Problem
In many physical locations, such as buildings, events, and transportation systems, it is important to verify the identity of users in order to provide secure and controlled access. Traditional methods of identity verification, such as physical ID cards and security guards, can be expensive and difficult to manage.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying claims about a user's identity. With EAS, physical locations can request and verify attested claims about a user's identity, such as their name, age, and access permissions. These attested claims are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a tamper-proof and transparent record of the user's identity.

## Future composability
In the future, EAS could be integrated with other decentralized technologies, such as smart contracts and decentralized storage systems, to enable more advanced and flexible solutions for verified user access in physical locations.

For example, a smart contract could be used to automatically grant or revoke access to a physical location based on a user's attested claims. This could be used to enable automatic access control in buildings, events, and transportation systems, eliminating the need for manual verification by security guards.

Additionally, EAS could be integrated with decentralized storage systems, such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), to enable users to store and manage their own attested claims in a decentralized and secure way. This would allow users to easily and securely share their attested claims with physical locations, enabling more convenient and efficient access control.

Overall, the future composability of EAS with other decentralized technologies has the potential to enable more secure, transparent, and efficient solutions for verified user access in physical locations.
