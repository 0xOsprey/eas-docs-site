# Reputation Systems

## Problem
In today's digital world, trust and reputation are increasingly important for individuals, businesses, and organizations to establish and maintain. Traditional methods of building trust and reputation, such as personal relationships and word-of-mouth referrals, can be slow and limited in scope. Online, trust and reputation are often based on subjective and unverifiable information, such as online reviews and social media posts, which can be manipulated and unreliable.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying claims about an individual's, business's, or organization's trust and reputation. With EAS, anyone can create and verify attested claims about their trustworthiness and reputation, providing a secure and transparent way to establish and maintain trust and reputation online.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability and interoperability of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for trust and reputation systems online.

For example, EAS could be integrated with decentralized identity (DID) providers, such as uPort or Civic, to enable individuals, businesses, and organizations to securely manage their own attested claims about their trust and reputation. This would allow them to easily and securely share their attested claims with others, enabling more convenient and efficient verification of the information.

Additionally, EAS could be integrated with blockchain-based reputation platforms, such as Trustology or Reputation.com, to enable more transparent and secure management of trust and reputation. For example, a smart contract could be used to automatically verify and update attested claims about an individual's, business's, or organization's trust and reputation, based on their online activities and interactions. This could be used to create more efficient and secure trust and reputation systems, while also providing a transparent and verifiable record of the information.

Overall, the future composability of EAS for trust and reputation systems online could unlock a wide range of possibilities for establishing and maintaining trust and reputation online, enabling more secure, efficient, and transparent solutions for verifying and managing this important information. This could ultimately benefit individuals, businesses, and organizations
