## Problem
The mortgage loan process can be complex, time-consuming, and vulnerable to fraud and errors. Traditional methods of verifying a borrower's creditworthiness, income, and other factors that are relevant to their loan application often involve manual processes and physical documentation, which can be slow and prone to errors.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying claims about a borrower's creditworthiness, income, and other factors that are relevant to their loan application. With EAS, lenders and borrowers can create and verify attested claims about these factors, providing a secure and transparent way to verify the information and streamline the loan application process.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability and interoperability of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for verified mortgage applications.

For example, EAS could be integrated with decentralized storage systems, such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), to enable borrowers to securely store and manage their attested claims about their creditworthiness, income, and other factors relevant to their loan application. This would allow borrowers to easily and securely share their attested claims with lenders, enabling more convenient and efficient verification of the information.

Additionally, EAS could be integrated with smart contracts and blockchain-based lending platforms to enable more automated and transparent verification of a borrower's creditworthiness and income. For example, a smart contract could be used to automatically verify a borrower's attested claims and determine their eligibility for a specific mortgage loan product. This could be used to enable more efficient and secure lending, while also providing a transparent and verifiable record of the loan application process.


## How to get started
In order to use Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for more verified mortgage loan applications, a mortgage company would need to take the following steps:

1. Define the schema for the attested claims that will be used to verify a borrower's creditworthiness and income. This would typically include information such as the borrower's credit score, income, employment status, and employment history.

2. Create a decentralized identity (DID) for each borrower, which will be used to securely store and manage their attested claims. This can be done using a DID provider or by creating a custom DID solution.

3. Develop the system for requesting and verifying attested claims about a borrower's creditworthiness and income. This could involve the use of smart contracts and other decentralized technologies to automate the verification process and ensure its integrity and transparency.

4. Test the system and refine it based on the results of the testing. This would involve conducting pilot loan applications and gathering feedback from borrowers and lenders to ensure that the system is user-friendly and effective.

Overall, the process of using EAS for more verified mortgage loan applications would involve the development and implementation of a decentralized and secure solution for verifying borrower creditworthiness and income. This would enable more transparent and secure lending, while also providing a verifiable and immutable record of the loan application process.
