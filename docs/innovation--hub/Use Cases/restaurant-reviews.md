# Restaurant reviews
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) could be used to create verified reputation systems for restaurants, allowing customers to easily and securely share their attested claims about their experiences at a restaurant.

## Problem
Traditional notarization processes can be time-consuming, costly, and inconvenient, requiring individuals to physically visit a notary and provide physical documentation. This can be a barrier for individuals who need to have documents notarized but are unable to do so easily due to location, availability, or other factors.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying attested claims about the authenticity of digital documents. With EAS, individuals can easily create and verify digital notarizations, providing a convenient and secure way to verify the authenticity of their documents.

## Example
A restaurant could request and verify attested claims about a customer's satisfaction with the food, service, and overall experience at the restaurant. This could be done using a schema that includes information such as the customer's rating of the food, service, and overall experience, as well as any comments or feedback they may have.

The restaurant could then use this information to improve its reputation and trustworthiness among potential customers. This could be done by displaying the attested claims on the restaurant's website or social media channels, or by integrating the information with existing online review platforms, such as Yelp or Google Reviews.

Additionally, the restaurant could use EAS to create and verify attested claims about its own trustworthiness and reputation, such as its commitment to food safety and hygiene, its use of sustainable and ethical ingredients, and its support for local charities and community initiatives. This could provide customers with more detailed and transparent information about the restaurant, enabling them to make more informed decisions about where to eat.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability of EAS could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for verified reputation systems for restaurants. For example, EAS could be integrated with blockchain-based food supply chain systems, such as Provenance or Blockverify, to enable customers to verify the authenticity and provenance of the food they are eating. This could be used to create more transparent and secure food supply chains, while also providing customers with a more detailed and verifiable record of the food they are consuming.

Overall, the use of EAS for verified reputation systems for restaurants could benefit both customers and restaurants by providing a more secure, efficient, and transparent way to manage and verify reputation data. This could ultimately enhance the trust and confidence of customers in the restaurant industry, and enable restaurants to build and maintain their reputation and trustworthiness in the digital economy.
