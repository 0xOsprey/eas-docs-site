# Decentralized Identity ðŸ¥¸

## Problem
Traditionally, online identity verification has relied on centralized systems and authorities, such as government-issued ID cards and utility bills. These systems can be slow, expensive, and vulnerable to fraud and identity theft.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying claims about a user's identity. With EAS, users can create and manage their own digital identity, attesting to claims about their identity using the Ethereum blockchain. These attested claims can be easily verified by any interested party, providing a secure and transparent way to prove the user's identity.

## Example use cases
1. Verifying the identity of users on online platforms and services, such as online banks, social networks, and e-commerce websites. EAS allows these platforms to request and verify attested claims about a user's identity, providing a secure and transparent way to verify the user's identity.

2. Creating and managing digital identity credentials, such as government-issued ID cards, driver's licenses, and passports. EAS allows users to create and manage their own digital identity, attesting to claims about their identity using the Ethereum blockchain.

3. Verifying the authenticity of physical documents, such as birth certificates, university degrees, and professional licenses. EAS allows these documents to be attested and verified on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a tamper-proof and transparent record of their authenticity.

4. Providing proof of identity for government services, such as voting, taxation, and social benefits. EAS allows governments to securely store and verify attested claims about a user's identity, providing a more efficient and secure way to provide these services.

5. Verifying the identity of participants in online transactions, such as peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, and auction websites. EAS allows these transactions to be securely and transparently verified using attested claims about the participants' identity.

## Future composability
EAS allows for the creation of attested claims about a wide range of identity-related information, such as educational qualifications, employment history, and criminal records. These claims can be composed and verified in combination with other attested claims to provide a comprehensive view of a user's identity.

Another way to improve interoperability is by using common protocols and standards for representing and exchanging identity-related information and registering it on EAS. For example, the W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) standards provide a common framework for representing and exchanging digital identity information in a decentralized and interoperable way.

By using common protocols and standards and registering them on EAS, different digital identity systems can more easily communicate and exchange information with each other, improving interoperability and enabling the creation of more powerful and flexible digital identity solutions.
