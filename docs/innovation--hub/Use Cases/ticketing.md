# Verified Ticketing

## Problem
The ticketing industry is plagued by issues such as fraud, scalping, and counterfeiting, which can lead to lost revenue, frustrated customers, and a lack of trust in the ticketing system. Traditional methods of verifying the authenticity of tickets, such as barcodes and holograms, can be easily copied or counterfeited, making it difficult to prevent fraud and ensure that only legitimate tickets are used.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution to verify attested claims about the authenticity of tickets. With EAS, event organizers and ticket sellers can create and verify attested claims about the legitimacy of tickets, providing a secure and transparent way to verify the authenticity of tickets and prevent fraud.

### Here's a few example ticketing applications that could be built:
1. A **decentralized ticketing platform** that allows event organizers and ticket sellers to create, issue, and verify attested tickets using EAS. This platform could be integrated with existing ticketing systems to provide a secure and transparent way to verify the authenticity of tickets and prevent fraud.

2. A **mobile app** that allows ticket holders to securely store and manage their attested tickets using EAS. This app could be used to easily and securely share attested tickets with event organizers and ticket sellers, enabling more convenient and efficient verification of the tickets.

3. A **smart contract** that automatically verifies the authenticity of attested tickets using EAS. This smart contract could be integrated with blockchain-based ticketing platforms and other systems to enable more automated and transparent verification of ticket legitimacy.

## Future composability
The future composability of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) in the ticketing industry could enable a wide range of innovative and flexible solutions for verifying the authenticity of tickets.

For example, EAS could be used to create and verify multiple types of attestations for tickets, such as attested claims about a ticket's origin, authenticity, and transfer history. These different types of attestations could be used together in various ways to create a greater ticketing ecosystem, with each attestation serving a different purpose and providing a unique layer of trust and transparency.

One potential application of this composability is the use of origin attestations to verify the source of a ticket. This could be used to prevent the sale of counterfeit or fraudulent tickets, as event organizers could create origin attestations for their tickets and require that these attestations be present in order for a ticket to be considered valid. This could be done using smart contracts and other decentralized technologies to automatically verify the origin attestations and ensure their integrity.

Another potential application of composability is the use of authenticity attestations to verify the legitimacy of a ticket. This could be used to prevent the use of copied or duplicated tickets, as event organizers could create authenticity attestations for their tickets and require that these attestations be present in order for a ticket to be considered valid. This could be done using advanced cryptographic techniques and other decentralized technologies to securely and transparently verify the authenticity attestations.

Finally, the use of transfer attestations could enable a more transparent and secure way to transfer tickets between ticket holders. This could be used to prevent the resale of tickets at inflated prices, as event organizers could create transfer attestations that limit the number of times a ticket can be transferred and require that these attestations be present in order for a ticket to be considered valid. This could be done using smart contracts and other decentralized technologies to automatically verify the transfer attestations and ensure their integrity.

Overall, the future composability of EAS for ticketing could enable a wide range of innovative and flexible solutions for verifying the authenticity of tickets, providing greater trust and transparency in the ticketing ecosystem.
