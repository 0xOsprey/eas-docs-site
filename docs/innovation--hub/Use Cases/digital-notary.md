# Digital Notarization Services
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) could be used to create a digital notarization system, allowing individuals and businesses to securely and easily verify the authenticity of documents.

## Problem
Traditional notarization processes can be time-consuming, costly, and inconvenient, requiring individuals to physically visit a notary and provide physical documentation. This can be a barrier for individuals who need to have documents notarized but are unable to do so easily due to location, availability, or other factors.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying attested claims about the authenticity of digital documents. With EAS, individuals can easily create and verify digital notarizations, providing a convenient and secure way to verify the authenticity of their documents.

## Example


## Example schema
`documentHash, notaryAddress, timeStamp`

## Example attestation
Sample



## Future composability
In the future, the composability and interoperability of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for digital notarization.

For example, EAS could be integrated with decentralized storage systems, such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), to enable individuals to securely store and manage their attested notarizations. This would allow individuals to easily and securely share their attested notarizations with others, enabling more convenient and efficient verification of the authenticity of their documents.

Additionally, EAS could be integrated with smart contracts and blockchain-based contract management systems to enable more automated and transparent verification of a document's notarization. For example, a smart contract could be used to automatically verify a document's notarization and determine its authenticity, providing a secure and verifiable way to enforce the terms of a contract.
