# Social Networks

## Problem
Social networks often have a problem with fake or spammy user profiles, which can damage the reputation of the network and decrease user trust. These fake profiles can be used for a variety of nefarious purposes, such as spreading misinformation or engaging in phishing attacks.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying claims about a user's identity. With EAS, social networks can request and verify non-transferrable attested claims about a user's identity, such as their name, proof of account ownership, and email address. These attested claims are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a tamper-proof and transparent record of the user's identity.

By requiring verified user profiles, social networks can increase user trust and reduce the presence of fake or spammy profiles on the network.

## Future composability
EAS allows for the creation of attested claims about a wide range of identity-related information, such as educational qualifications, employment history, and interests. These claims can be composed and verified in combination with other attested claims to provide a more complete and accurate view of a user's identity on social networks.
