# Supply Chain Provenance

## Problem
Supply chains are complex and global networks that involve multiple stakeholders and intermediaries. Ensuring the provenance and authenticity of goods and materials in these supply chains can be challenging, and is often reliant on manual processes and third-party certifications.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying claims about the provenance of goods and products. With EAS, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers can create and verify attested claims about the origin, composition, and history of a product, providing a secure and transparent way to verify its authenticity and provenance.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability of EAS with other decentralized supply chain solutions could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for supply chain provenance verification.

For example, a blockchain-based tracking system could be used to automatically record the movement of goods and materials through a supply chain, providing a transparent and verifiable record of their journey. This tracking system could be integrated with EAS to allow stakeholders in the supply chain to attest to claims about the provenance and authenticity of the goods and materials, providing a more complete view of their provenance.

Additionally, EAS could be integrated with decentralized storage systems, such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), to enable stakeholders in the supply chain to securely store and manage their attested claims in a decentralized and transparent way. This would allow for the creation of a decentralized and verifiable record of a product's provenance, enabling consumers and regulators to easily verify the authenticity and quality of the product.

Overall, the future composability of EAS with other decentralized supply chain solutions has the potential to enable more transparent, verifiable, and efficient solutions for supply chain provenance verification.
