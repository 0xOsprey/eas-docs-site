## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
**Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** is the global base layer for [Attestations](/docs/learn/attestations) on the Ethereum blockchain. EAS is a free, open-source, decentralized, composable, permissionless, tokenless, and pulic good that enables anyone to create and register unique attestation schemas and use them to make attestations about anything.

Whether you need to prove your identity, verify your credentials, or prove ownership of an asset, EAS makes it easy to create and verify attestations in a trustless, secure, and transparent way. With EAS, developers can build applications that make use of attestations for a wide range of purposes, from identity verification to supply chain management and beyond.

Our comprehensive developer documentation will help you get started with EAS, from setting up your environment to creating and using attestations. We also provide examples and tutorials to help you understand how EAS works and how you can use it in your own projects.

We're excited to see what you'll build with EAS, and we can't wait to see how you'll use attestations to create a more trustful and transparent world. 

### ðŸŒŽ The Global Registry for Attestations
EAS serves as the base layer where all attestors and innovators can coordinate, create, register, and compose unique attestation schemas. This enables interoperability and composability between different attestation protocols and solutions, allowing the attestation layer to grow and evolve over time.

There are many existing on-chain solutions for identity, verifications, claims, and cryptographic proofs, but each of these protocols is tailored to specific use cases and communities. This fragmentation and lack of composability limit the potential of these solutions. EAS brings these protocols together, enabling them to work together smoothly and allowing for the creation of new, more powerful attestation solutions.

### ðŸ”“ Free, open-source and permissionless.
EAS is an open-source and permissionless platform, meaning anyone can use it and contribute to its development. EAS is built by the community and for the community, holding the original promises of blockchain true:

- **open-source**, meaning anyone can use it.
- **decentralized**, meaning it is not owned by any one person or company, but supported by the ETH community.
- **tokenless**, as all transactions are settled with Ethereum.
- a **public good**, meaning it is free to use and created for the greater good of the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **interoperable**, meaning different parts of the attestation layer can work together smoothly.
- **composable**, meaning attestations can be added and built like lego blocks on top of each other and with each other.
- **permissionless**, meaning you do not need permission from a centralized entity, person, or group to use EAS. 

### ðŸ§± EAS does not presuppose anything
EAS is a primitive base layer. It does not presuppose anything such as how it will be used or the correct schema structure for a use case. It is designed to be a foundation that can be used to build more specific and complex systems on top of it and can be tailored to fit the needs of different users. This primitive layer will enable the freedom to create and reinforce the **right schemas** and attestations for the **right use cases** for the **right users** overtime. 

### ðŸš„ Elegantly simple smart contracts
EAS runs on two elegant and simple smart contracts. One for [**registering attestation Schemas**](docs/technical--docs/contracts), and another to [**attest with them**](docs/technical--docs/contracts). Schemas can be registered for any use case and attestations can be done on-chain or off-chain.

In addition, we provide a resolver contract for advanced use cases, such as on-chain verification of attestation data, and also attaching payments to attestations (which makes a new suite of powerful web3 applications possible).

### ðŸ’¡What you can build with EAS.
EAS allows for a wide range of possibilities for entrepreneurs and developers to build applications that make use of attestations. Some examples of things that can be built with EAS include:

1. **Identity verification systems** that use attestations to prove the authenticity of a person's identity, credentials, or other information. This could be used for things like online voting systems, access control systems, or even building a decentralized version of a traditional identity verification system like a passport.
2. **Reputation systems** that use attestations to verify the reputation or trustworthiness of individuals, organizations, or businesses. This could be used for things like peer-to-peer lending platforms, online marketplaces, or even a decentralized version of a traditional credit scoring system.
3. **Certification systems** that use attestations to verify the authenticity of a person's skills, qualifications, or experience. This could be used for things like online education platforms, job application systems, or even a decentralized version of a traditional certification system like a college degree.
4. **Supply chain tracking systems** that use attestations to verify the authenticity of information about the origin, history, or quality of goods. This could be used for things like tracking the provenance of luxury goods, ensuring the safety of food products, or even building a decentralized version of a traditional supply chain tracking system.

These are just a few examples of the many things that can be built with EAS. Ultimately, the possibilities are limited only by the imagination of entrepreneurs and developers who want to build applications that make use of attestations.

Check out this [**ever-growing list of use cases**](/docs/category/use-cases) that can be built with EAS. 

## âœ¨ Why EAS exists.
EAS exists to be the global base layer where anything and everything can be attested to. Our vision is to create a world where trust is restored and increased through a global, open, and interoperable attestation layer.

We believe that by creating a free and open-source platform for attestations, we can foster innovation and enable people to verify and trust each other in a more efficient and transparent way. Join us and help build the global attestation layer for the Ethereum ecosystem.

## ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started
We're excited to see what you build with EAS. Let's get started!

1. Read the documentation to [**learn more about attestations**](https://twitter.com/eas_eth) and how to use EAS.
2. Explore the [**registry of attestation schemas**](https://twitter.com/eas_eth) and see what is available.
3. Register your [**own attestation schemas**](https://twitter.com/eas_eth) using the EAS smart contracts or UI.
4. Use the EAS attestation service to create and verify attestations for any purpose.
