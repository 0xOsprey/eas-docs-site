# Welcome to EAS 
![EAS Banner](/img/eas-twitter-banner-v2.png)

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
**Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** is the global base layer for registering and creating [Attestations](/docs/learn/attestations). EAS is a free open-source, decentralized, composable, permissionless, tokenless, **public good** built on Ethereum. 

Attestations are digital records that verify the authenticity of information, such as a person's identity or credentials. EAS allows for interoperability and composability between different attestation protocols and solutions, enabling the attestation layer to grow and change over time. Whether you need to prove your identity, credentials, or other information, EAS allows you to do so in a flexible and simple way. 

EAS offers endless possibilities for entrepreneurs and developers to verify and compose attestations in a trustless manner by making it possible for different attestation schemas to work together and be used for a wide range of applications. EAS includes a built-in attestation service and a registry of attestation schemas, allowing anyone to create and use attestations for any purpose. 

### ðŸŒŽ The Global Registry for Attestations
EAS serves as the base layer where all attestors and innovators can coordinate, create, register, and compose unique attestation schemas. This enables interoperability and composability between different attestation protocols and solutions, allowing the attestation layer to grow and change over time.

There are several existing tailor-made on-chain solutions for identity, verifications, claims, and cryptographic proofs. Each of these innovations are essential building blocks for specific use cases and communities, but each tailor-made protocol increases fragmentation and limits composability.

### ðŸ”“ Free, open-source and permissionless.
EAS is an open-source and permissionless platform, meaning anyone can use it and contribute to its development. EAS is built by the community and for the community, holding the original promises of blockchain true:

- **open-source**, meaning anyone can use it.
- **decentralized**, meaning it is not owned by any one person or company, but supported by the ETH community.
- **tokenless**, as all transactions are settled with Ethereum.
- a **public good**, meaning it is free to use and created for the greater good of the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **interoperable**, meaning different parts of the attestation layer can work together smoothly.
- **composable**, meaning attestations can be added and built like lego blocks on top of each other and with each other.
- **permissionless**, meaning you do not need permission from a centralized entity, person, or group to use EAS. 

### ðŸ§± EAS does not presuppose anything
EAS is a primitive base layer. It does not presuppose anything such as how it will be used or the correct schema structure for a use case. It is designed to be a foundation that can be used to build more specific and complex systems on top of it and can be tailored to fit the needs of different users. This primitive layer will enable the freedom to create and reinforce the **right schemas** and attestations for the **right use cases** for the **right users** overtime. 


### ðŸš„ Elegantly simple smart contracts
EAS runs on two elegant and simple smart contracts. One for [**registering attestation Schemas**](docs/technical--docs/contracts), and another to [**attest with them**](docs/technical--docs/contracts). Schemas can be registered for any use case and attestations can be done on-chain or off-chain.

In addition, we provide a resolver contract for advanced use cases, such as on-chain verification of attestation data, and also attaching payments to attestations (which makes a new suite of powerful web3 applications possible).


## âœ¨ Why EAS exists.
EAS exists to be the global base layer where anything and everything can be attested to. Our vision is to create a world where trust is restored and increased through a global, open, and interoperable attestation layer.

We believe that by creating a free and open-source platform for attestations, we can foster innovation and enable people to verify and trust each other in a more efficient and transparent way. Join us and help build the global attestation layer for the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Getting Started
To get started with EAS, you can:

1. Read the documentation to [**learn more about attestations**](https://twitter.com/eas_eth) and how to use EAS.
2. Explore the [**registry of attestation schemas**](https://twitter.com/eas_eth) and see what is available.
3. Register your [**own attestation schemas**](https://twitter.com/eas_eth) using the EAS smart contracts or UI.
4. Use the EAS attestation service to create and verify attestations for any purpose.
