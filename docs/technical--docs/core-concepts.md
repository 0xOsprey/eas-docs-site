# Core Concepts
Understand a few of the key concepts about EAS, how it works, and why it's different.


### ðŸ§± The Base Layer Registry
There are several existing tailor-made on-chain solutions for identity, verifications, claims, and cryptographic proofs. Each of these innovations are essential building blocks for specific use cases and communities, but each tailor-made protocol increases fragmentation and limits composability. 

EAS introduces and serves as the base layer where all attestors and innovators can coordinate, create, register, and compose unique attestation schemas.

### ðŸŒŽ Future Composability
As builders we recognized the need for a public service that enabled greater composability and standardization to create the attestation layer in Web3.

EAS is built on the original promises of blockchain to be completely open-source and owned by community for the community. As a public good, EAS is tokenless and permissionless built to coordinate ETH ecosystem growth. Use ETH to settle transactions.

### ðŸš„ Elegantly simple smart contracts
EAS runs on two elegant and simple smart contracts. One for **registering attestation Schemas**, and another to **attest to them**. Schemas can be registered for any use case and attestations can be done on-chain or off-chain.

In addition, we provide a resolver contract for advanced use cases, such as on-chain verification of attestation data, and also attaching payments to attestations (which makes a new suite of powerful web3 applications possible).
