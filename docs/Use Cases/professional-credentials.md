#  üßë‚Äçüéì Professional credentials

## Problem
Verifying the authenticity of an individual's educational and professional credentials can be challenging, and is often reliant on manual processes and third-party certifications. This can be time-consuming and prone to errors, and can also create barriers to the trust and transparency that are essential for the credibility of credentials.

## Solution
With EAS, credentialing organizations can issue and manage professional credentials and certifications using the Ethereum blockchain. These credentials and certifications can be easily create, stored, and verified by any interested party, providing a secure and transparent way to prove the user's qualifications and skills.

## Example
Alice is a professional who has earned a certification from the XYZ Professional Organization. The XYZ Organization uses EAS to issue and manage Alice's certification, attesting to the fact that she has successfully completed the certification requirements. This attestation is cryptographically signed and added to the blockchain, where it can be easily verified by others.

Alice can then use her digital identity, along with her certification attestation, to securely and transparently prove her qualifications and skills to others. For example, she can include her digital identity and certification attestation in her resume, allowing potential employers to verify the authenticity and accuracy of her certification using EAS. This can help to improve the trust and credibility of Alice's resume, and can also provide potential employers with a more comprehensive view of her qualifications and skills.

## Example schema 
```
string name;
string degree;
string major;
string minor;
string institution;
uint256 graduationYear;
bytes32 transcriptHash;

```

## Example attestation
```
name: "Alice"
degree: "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science"
major: "Computer Science"
minor: "Mathematics"
institution: "University of California, Berkeley"
graduationYear: 2018
transcriptHash: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

```

## Future composability
In the future, the composability of EAS with other decentralized credential verification solutions could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for verifying the credentials of individuals.

The use of EAS in credentialing can enable new and innovative use cases, such as verified professional networks, skills matching, and career advancement. For example, professionals who have verified their credentials and certifications using EAS could have a verified badge on their profile, indicating that their credentials have been attested and verified on the Ethereum blockchain. This could help to improve the quality and trustworthiness of professional networks, and could also enable new features and services that require verified credential information.

Further, a blockchain-based reputation system could be used to automatically record the achievements and experiences of individuals, providing a transparent and verifiable record of their professional history. This reputation system could be integrated with EAS to allow individuals and organizations to attest the credentials and qualifications of individuals, providing a more complete view of their credentials.

Overall, the future composability of EAS with other decentralized credential verification solutions has the potential to enable more transparent, verifiable, and efficient solutions for verifying the credentials of individuals.
