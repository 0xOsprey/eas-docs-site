#  üìçSupply Chain Provenance

## Problem
Supply chains are complex and global networks that involve multiple stakeholders and intermediaries. Ensuring the provenance and authenticity of goods and materials in these supply chains can be challenging, and is often reliant on manual processes and third-party certifications.

## Solution
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides a decentralized solution for securely storing and verifying claims about the provenance of goods and products. With EAS, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers can create and verify attested claims about the origin, composition, and history of a product, providing a secure and transparent way to verify its authenticity and provenance.

## Example
Alice is a manager at a clothing company that needs to verify the provenance of a batch of shirts that will be sold to Bob's department store. Using EAS, Alice can create an attested claim about the provenance of the shirts, which includes information such as the origin of the raw materials, the location of the manufacturing facility, and the dates of production and packaging.

Alice can then share this attested claim with Bob, who can easily and securely verify the provenance of the shirts using the EAS platform. This allows Bob to ensure that the shirts meet his standards for quality and transparency, and that they were produced in an ethical and sustainable manner.

Additionally, because the attested claim is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, it is transparent and verifiable by anyone who has access to the platform. This provides a secure and immutable record of the product's provenance, ensuring the integrity of the supply chain and the trustworthiness of the parties involved.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability of EAS with other decentralized supply chain solutions could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for supply chain provenance verification.

For example, a blockchain-based tracking system could be used to automatically record the movement of goods and materials through a supply chain, providing a transparent and verifiable record of their journey. This tracking system could be integrated with EAS to allow stakeholders in the supply chain to attest to claims about the provenance and authenticity of the goods and materials, providing a more complete view of their provenance.

Additionally, EAS could be integrated with decentralized storage systems, such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), to enable stakeholders in the supply chain to securely store and manage their attested claims in a decentralized and transparent way. This would allow for the creation of a decentralized and verifiable record of a product's provenance, enabling consumers and regulators to easily verify the authenticity and quality of the product.

Overall, the future composability of EAS with other decentralized supply chain solutions has the potential to enable more transparent, verifiable, and efficient solutions for supply chain provenance verification.
