#  üìçSupply Chain Provenance

## Problem
Supply chains are complex and global networks that involve multiple stakeholders and intermediaries. Ensuring the provenance and authenticity of goods and materials in these supply chains can be challenging, and is often reliant on manual processes and third-party certifications.

## Solution
EAS provides a decentralized solution for securely creating, storing, and verifying attestations about the provenance of goods and products. With EAS, manufacturers, retailers, and consumers can create and verify attestations about the origin, composition, and history of a product, providing a secure and transparent way to verify its authenticity and provenance.

## Example
A clothing company could use EAS to create and verify attestations about the materials and labor used in the production of its clothing, as well as the transportation and distribution of its products. This could be done using schemas that include information such as the origin of the materials, the ethical and environmental standards used in production, and the certification and safety standards of the transportation and distribution process.

The company could then use this information to enhance the trustworthiness and transparency of its supply chain, and provide customers with more detailed and accurate information about the products they are purchasing. This could be done by displaying the attestations on the company's website or social media channels, or by integrating the information with existing supply chain management systems.

## Example schema 
```
string productName;
bytes32 productSKU;
string origin;
string manufacturer;
uint256 productionDate;
uint256 expirationDate;
bytes32 rawMaterialHash;
address certifier;

```

## Example attestation
```
productName: "Organic Cotton T-Shirt"
productSKU: "123456"
origin: "India"
manufacturer: "Fair Trade Certified Facility"
productionDate: 1546300800
expirationDate: 1607068800
rawMaterialHash: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
certifier: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678

```
## Example business ideas

1. "ChainVerify": A supply chain verification service that uses EAS to create attestations about the provenance and quality of goods, enabling consumers to make informed purchasing decisions.
2. "ProvenanceX": A blockchain-based supply chain management platform that uses EAS to track and verify the origin, authenticity, and quality of goods, enabling businesses to improve the transparency and trustworthiness of their supply chain.
3. "TrueTrack": A supply chain tracking and verification service that uses EAS to create attestations about the movement and condition of goods, enabling businesses to improve the efficiency and visibility of their supply chain operations.
4. "SupplySecure": A supply chain security and compliance platform that uses EAS to create attestations about the compliance and sustainability of goods, enabling businesses to meet regulatory requirements and reduce their environmental impact.
5. "TrustChain": A supply chain consortium that uses EAS to create attestations about the quality and sustainability of goods, enabling businesses to differentiate their products and build trust with consumers.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability of EAS with other decentralized supply chain solutions could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for supply chain provenance verification.

For example, a blockchain-based tracking system could be used to automatically record the movement of goods and materials through a supply chain, providing a transparent and verifiable record of their journey. This tracking system could be integrated with EAS to allow stakeholders in the supply chain to attestations about the provenance and authenticity of the goods and materials, providing a more complete view of their provenance.

Additionally, EAS could be integrated with decentralized storage systems, such as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), to enable stakeholders in the supply chain to securely store and manage their attestations in a decentralized and transparent way. This would allow for the creation of a decentralized and verifiable record of a product's provenance, enabling consumers and regulators to easily verify the authenticity and quality of the product.

Overall, the future composability of EAS with other decentralized supply chain solutions has the potential to enable more transparent, verifiable, and efficient solutions for supply chain provenance verification.
