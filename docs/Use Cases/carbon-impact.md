# ðŸŒ± Certifying Carbon Impact

## Problem
Consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of the products and services they use. However, it can be difficult for consumers to accurately assess the carbon footprint and other environmental impacts of the products and services they purchase. This lack of transparency can lead to the purchase of products and services with a high environmental impact, contributing to climate change and other environmental problems.

## Solution
EAS can be used to make attestations about the environmental impact of products and services. By creating a schema that defines the data fields and types relevant to environmental impact, such as carbon footprint, energy usage, and waste generation, companies can create attestations that provide transparent and verifiable information about the environmental impact of their products and services.

## Example
Alice is a consumer who is looking to purchase a new television. She wants to make sure that the television she chooses has a low environmental impact, so she uses an application powered by EAS to search for attestations about the environmental impact of different television models. She finds that the model she is considering has an attestation that provides detailed information about its carbon footprint, energy usage, and waste generation.

Alice reviews the attestation and is satisfied with the information it provides. She decides to purchase the television, knowing that its environmental impact has been transparently and verifiably disclosed.

## Example schema
``` bash
uint256 carbonFootPrint;
uint256 energyUsage;
uint256 wasteGeneration;

```

## Example attestation
``` jsx
{
  "carbon footprint": "500 kg CO2/year",
  "energy usage": "150 kWh/year",
  "waste generation": "1 kg/year"
}
```

## Example business ideas
1. **CarbonChain** - A decentralized platform that uses EAS to certify and track the carbon footprint of products and services.
2. **EcoVerify** - An EAS-powered app that allows consumers to easily verify the environmental impact of products before making a purchase.
3. **GreenTrade** - A marketplace for environmentally-friendly products, where sellers can use EAS to certify and prove the sustainability of their offerings.
4. **CarbonCredit** - A platform for companies to offset their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects, using EAS to track and verify their contributions.
5. **CarbonScore** - A rating system for products and services, using EAS to evaluate and score their environmental impact.
6. **EcoCert** - An independent certification body that uses EAS to certify and verify the sustainability of products and services.
7. **CarbonPass** - A digital passport for products and services, using EAS to store and share their environmental impact data with consumers.
8. **GreenLabel** - A label for eco-friendly products, powered by EAS to verify and certify their sustainability.
9. **CarbonTracker** - A tool for companies to monitor and manage their carbon footprint, using EAS to collect and analyze data.
10. **EcoAudit** - An auditing service that uses EAS to evaluate and certify the sustainability of products and services.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability of EAS with other decentralized technologies could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for certifying the environmental impact of products and services.

For example, EAS could be integrated with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to enable consumers to invest in products and services with low environmental impact. This could involve the creation of DeFi products that are backed by environmental impact attestations, allowing consumers to invest in sustainable products and earn returns based on their environmental performance.

Additionally, EAS could be integrated with smart contracts to enable more automated and transparent verification of environmental impact attestations. For example, a smart contract could be used to automatically verify the accuracy of environmental impact attestations and determine the eligibility of products and services for sustainability certifications.
