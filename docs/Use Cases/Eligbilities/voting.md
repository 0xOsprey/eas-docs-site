# Voter Eligibility 
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) could be used to create a voter identification and eligibility system, allowing governments to securely and easily verify the identity and eligibility of voters.

## Problem
In traditional voting systems, it can be difficult to verify the identity and eligibility of voters, as the process often involves manual verification and verification of paper documents. This can lead to issues such as fraud, voter suppression, and long wait times, resulting in low voter turnout and mistrust in the electoral process.

## Solution
EAS can be used to create a secure and transparent system for verifying the identity and eligibility of voters. By leveraging the immutability and decentralization of the blockchain, EAS can allow election officials to create cryptographically signed attestations of voter information, which can then be verified by polling stations and other entities. This provides a more robust and secure way to verify the eligibility and identity of voters, and can help to prevent fraud and errors.

## Example 
Alice is a voter who needs to verify her eligibility to vote in an upcoming election. Using EAS, Alice can create an attestation about her identity and eligibility, which includes information such as her name, date of birth, and proof of citizenship.

Alice can then share this attestation with the election officials, who can easily and securely verify her eligibility using the EAS platform. This allows the officials to quickly and accurately confirm Alice's eligibility to vote, without the need for manual verification or paper documents.

Additionally, because the attestation is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, it is transparent and verifiable by anyone who has access to the platform. This provides a secure and immutable record of the voter's eligibility, ensuring the integrity of the election and the trustworthiness of the parties involved.

## Example schema
```bash
string fullName;
string address;
bytes32 dateOfBirth;
bytes32 citizenshipStatus;
```

## Example attestation
``` bash
fullName: "Alice Smith"
address: "123 Main Street, Anytown USA"
dateOfBirth: "01/01/1970"
citizenshipStatus: "US citizen"

```

## Example business ideas
1. **VeriVote** - a platform that allows voters to securely and easily verify their eligibility to vote using EAS. VeriVote helps prevent voter fraud and ensures that only eligible voters are able to participate in elections.
2. **ID-U-Sure** - a digital ID verification service that uses EAS to attest to the validity of users' identification documents. ID-U-Sure helps organizations quickly and securely verify users' identities online.
3. **TrustTheVote** - a decentralized voting platform that uses EAS to securely and transparently manage the voting process. TrustTheVote helps ensure the integrity of elections and allows voters to easily verify their votes were counted accurately.
4. **CivicSign** - a digital signing platform that uses EAS to securely and easily verify the identity of signers. CivicSign helps businesses and individuals securely sign and manage their digital documents.
5. **eBallotBox** - an online voting platform that uses EAS to securely and transparently manage the voting process. eBallotBox helps organizations conduct elections and allows voters to easily verify their votes were counted accurately.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability of Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) with other decentralized technologies could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for verified voter identification and eligibility.

EAS could be integrated with smart contracts and blockchain-based voting systems to enable more automated and transparent verification of a voter's eligibility. For example, a smart contract could be used to automatically verify a voter's attestations and determine their eligibility to vote in a specific election. This could be used to enable more efficient and secure voting, while also providing a transparent and verifiable record of the voter's eligibility.
