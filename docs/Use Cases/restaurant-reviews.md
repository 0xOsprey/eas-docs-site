#  ðŸŒŸ Restaurant Reviews
Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) could be used to create verified reputation systems for restaurants, allowing customers to easily and securely share their attested claims about their experiences at a restaurant.

## Problem
Currently, online review platforms for restaurants are vulnerable to fake or biased reviews, which can make it difficult for customers to trust the information they are reading.

## Solution
EAS enables the creation of verified reputation systems for restaurants, where customers can share attested claims about their experiences at a restaurant. This provides a more secure and trustworthy way for customers to share their opinions and feedback, while also enabling restaurants to improve their reputation and trustworthiness.

## Example
A restaurant could request and verify attested claims about a customer's satisfaction with the food, service, and overall experience at the restaurant. This could be done using a schema that includes information such as the customer's rating of the food, service, and overall experience, as well as any comments or feedback they may have.

The restaurant could then use this information to improve its reputation and trustworthiness among potential customers. This could be done by displaying the attested claims on the restaurant's website or social media channels, or by integrating the information with existing online review platforms, such as Yelp or Google Reviews.

Additionally, the restaurant could use EAS to create and verify attested claims about its own trustworthiness and reputation, such as its commitment to food safety and hygiene, its use of sustainable and ethical ingredients, and its support for local charities and community initiatives. This could provide customers with more detailed and transparent information about the restaurant, enabling them to make more informed decisions about where to eat.

## Example schema
``` jsx
struct RestaurantReview {
  address reviewer;
  string restaurantName;
  uint256 rating;
  string review;
  uint256 timestamp;
}
```

## Example attestation
```jsx
{
  "type": "RestaurantReview",
  "data": {
    "reviewer": "0xA726Bd2a4b7fC3B095F726Ce5C5a7E57b0D4B903",
    "restaurantName": "The Cheesecake Factory",
    "rating": 5,
    "review": "Great food and service! Highly recommend the avocado egg rolls and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.",
    "timestamp": 1623987217
  }
}
```
## Example use cases to solve for
1. **Verifying the identity of reviewers**: By requiring reviewers to provide attested claims about their identity, restaurant owners can be more confident that the reviews they are reading are from real people, rather than fake or anonymous accounts.

2. **Verifying the authenticity of reviews**: By requiring reviewers to provide attested claims about their dining experience, such as the date and time of their visit, the name of their server, and the dishes they ordered, restaurant owners can be more confident that the reviews they are reading are genuine and accurate.

3. **Providing proof of experience**: By requiring reviewers to provide attested claims about their dining experience, such as the number of visits they have made to the restaurant, the type of food they typically order, and their overall satisfaction with the service and food, restaurant owners can gain valuable insights into the preferences and behaviors of their regular customers.

4. **Improving the trustworthiness of reviews**: By providing a secure and transparent way to verify the identity and authenticity of reviewers and their reviews, attestations can help to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of online restaurant reviews, which can help to improve the overall quality of the dining experience for both customers and restaurant owners.

5. **Enhancing the customer experience**: By allowing customers to easily verify the identity and authenticity of reviewers and their reviews, attestations can help to enhance the customer experience by providing more accurate and reliable information about the quality of the restaurant and its food. This can help customers to make more informed and confident dining decisions, and can also help restaurant owners to improve the quality of their service and food.

## Example business ideas
1. "Verified & Vouch'd" - a platform that allows customers to leave verified reviews of restaurants based on their dining experiences. The platform uses EAS to ensure that reviews are authentic and not fake.
2. "Foodie Force" - a mobile app that helps customers find the best restaurants in their area based on verified reviews and ratings. The app uses EAS to verify the authenticity of reviews and ratings.
3. "Dish Detective" - a service that helps restaurants verify the authenticity of their food and ingredients. Customers can use the service to check the provenance of the food they are eating and make sure it is sourced from reputable suppliers.
4. "Taste Tracker" - a platform that allows customers to track the journey of their food from farm to table. The platform uses EAS to verify the authenticity of the information provided by restaurants and food suppliers.
5. "Foodie Friends" - a social network for foodies that allows them to connect with each other and share verified reviews and ratings of restaurants. The platform uses EAS to ensure that reviews are authentic and not fake.

## Future composability
In the future, the composability of EAS could enable more advanced and flexible solutions for verified reputation systems for restaurants. For example, EAS could be integrated with blockchain-based food supply chain systems to enable customers to verify the authenticity and provenance of the food they are eating. This could be used to create more transparent and secure food supply chains, while also providing customers with a more detailed and verifiable record of the food they are consuming.

Overall, the use of EAS for verified reputation systems for restaurants could benefit both customers and restaurants by providing a more secure, efficient, and transparent way to manage and verify reputation data. This could ultimately enhance the trust and confidence of customers in the restaurant industry, and enable restaurants to build and maintain their reputation and trustworthiness in the digital economy.
