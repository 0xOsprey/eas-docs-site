# Install the Snap
To begin using the EAS MetaMask Snap, you'll need to have the MetaMask extension installed in your web browser. If you haven't already installed MetaMask, you can download it from [**MetaMask's official website**](https://metamask.io/).

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide
1. **Open MetaMask Extension** Click on the MetaMask icon in your browser to open the extension.

2. **Access the Snaps Feature** 
In the MetaMask UI, locate the 'Snaps' section. This can usually be found in the settings or extensions menu within MetaMask.

3. **Add EAS MetaMask Snap**
Look for an option to 'Discover Snaps' or 'Add New Snap'. Here, search for 'EAS MetaMask Snap' or enter the URL provided by the EAS Snap host.

4. **Install the Snap**
Click on the 'Install' or 'Add to MetaMask' button next to the EAS MetaMask Snap listing. Follow any additional prompts to complete the installation.

5. **Grant Permissions** 
The Snap may request certain permissions to operate correctly. Review these permissions and grant them if you agree.

6. **Verify Installation**
Once installed, the EAS Snap should appear in your list of active Snaps within MetaMask. You can verify this by revisiting the 'Snaps' section.

7. **Update MetaMask If Needed** 
If you encounter any issues, ensure your MetaMask extension is updated to the latest version.

## Post-Installation
1. **Test the Snap:**
